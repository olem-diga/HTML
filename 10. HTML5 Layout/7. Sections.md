# Sections
**`<section>`**
The **`<section>`** element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

For example, on a homepage there may be several **`<section>`** elements to contain diï¬€erent sections of the page, such as latest news, top products, and newsletter signup.

Because the **`<section>`** element groups related items together, it may contain several distinct **`<article>`** elements that have a common theme or purpose.

Alternatively, if you have a page with a long article, the **`<section>`** element can be used to split the article up into separate sections.
The **`<section>`** element should not be used as a wrapper for the entire page (unless the page only contains one distinct piece of content). If you want a containing element for the entire page, that job is still best left to the **`<div>`** element.
