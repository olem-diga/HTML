# Heading Groups
**`<hgroup>`**
The purpose of the  **`<hgroup>`**  element is to group together a set of one or more **`<h1>`** through **`<h6>`** elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
- *Example:*
```html
<hgroup>
	<h2>Japanese Vegetarian</h2>
	<h3>Five week course in London</h3>
</hgroup>
```

- *Result:*
<hgroup>
	<h2>Japanese Vegetarian</h2>
	<h3>Five week course in London</h3>
</hgroup>

For example, the  **`<hgroup>`**  element could be used to contain both a title inside an **`<h2>`** element and a subtitle within an **`<h3>`** element.

This element has had a mixed reception. When it was Ô¨Årst proposed by the people developing HTML5, there were some complaints and it was withdrawn from the HTML5 proposals. However, some people changed their minds and it has been added it back into the language. Some developers do not like the use of the  **`<hgroup>`**  element, and prefer to place a subtitle inside a **`<p>`** element (using an attribute to indicate that it is a subheading).

Some suggest that it is of little use other than as a styling hook. It has, however, been popular with those developers who believe that it is useful to group together the primary heading and the subheading (as both can be integral parts of a heading).
