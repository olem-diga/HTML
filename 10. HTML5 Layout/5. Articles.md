# Articles
**`<article>`**
The **`<article>`** element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.

If a page contains several articles (or even summaries of several articles), then each individual article would live inside its own **`<article>`** element.

The **`<article>`** elements can even be nested inside each other. For example, a blog post might live inside one **`<article>`** element and each comment on the article could live inside its own child **`<article>`** element.
