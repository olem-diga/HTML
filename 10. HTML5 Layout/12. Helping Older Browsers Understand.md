# Helping Older Browsers Understand

Older browsers that do not know the new HTML5 elements will automatically treat them as inline elements. Therefore, to help older browsers, you should include the line of CSS below which states which new elements should be rendered as block-level elements.

```css
header, section, footer, aside, nav, article, figure{
	display: block;
}
```

Also, IE9 was the Ô¨Årst version of Internet Explorer to allow **CSS** rules to be associated with these new HTML5 layout elements. In order to style these elements using earlier versions of IE, you need to use a simple **JavaScript** known as the **HTML5 shiv** or **HTML5 shim**.

You do not need to understand JavaScript to use it. You can just link to a copy that Google hosts on its servers. It should be placed inside a conditional comment which checks if the browser version is less than (hence the **`lt`**) IE9.

Unfortunately, this workaround does require that anyone using IE8 or earlier versions of IE has JavaScript enabled in their browser. If they do not have JavaScript enabled then they will not be able to see the content of these HTML5 elements.
