# Figures
**`<figure>`** **`<figcaption>`**
You already met the  **`<figure>`**  element when we looked at images. It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main ﬂow of an article (not just images).

It is important to note that the article should still make sense if the content of the  **`<figure>`** element were moved (to another part of the page, or even to a diﬀerent page altogether). For this reason, it should only be used when the content simply references the element (and not for something that is absolutely integral to the ﬂow of a page).

**Examples of usage include:**
- Images
- Videos
- Graphs
- Diagrams
- Code samples
- Text that supports the main body of an article

The  **`<figure>`**  element should also contain a **`<figcaption>`** element which provides a text decription for the content of the  **`<figure>`**  element.
