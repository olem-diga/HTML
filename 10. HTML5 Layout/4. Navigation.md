# Navigation
**`<nav>`**
The **`<nav>`** element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

Going back to our blog example, if you wanted to Ô¨Ånish an article with links to related blog posts, these would not be counted as major navigational blocks and therefore should not sit inside a **`<nav>`** element.
