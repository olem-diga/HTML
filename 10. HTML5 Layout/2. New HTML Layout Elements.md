# New HTML Layout Elements

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will Ô¨Ånd in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

<figure align="center">
<img src="New Layout Elements.png" width ="60%" />
<figcaption> This example has exactly the same structure as seen above. However, many of the <b> div </b> elements have been replaced by new HTML5 layout elements. </figcaption>
</figure>

For example, the header sits inside a new **`<header>`** element, the navigation in a **`<nav>`** element, and the articles are in individual **`<article>`** elements.

The point of creating these new elements is so that web page authors can use them to help describe the structure of the page. For example, screen reader software might allow users to ignore headers and footers and get straight to the content. Similarly, search engines might place more weight on the content in an **`<article>`** element than that in the **`<header>`** or **`<footer>`** elements. I think you will agree that it also makes the code easier to follow.
