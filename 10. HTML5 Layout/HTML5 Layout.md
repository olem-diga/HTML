# HTML5 Layout


HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help deﬁne the structure of a page.

These new elements are going to play an important part in creating layouts. In this chapter you will see:
- The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
- How they oﬀer helpful alternatives to the **`<div>`** element
- How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements

As with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still subject to change but it is already widely being used by web developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.
