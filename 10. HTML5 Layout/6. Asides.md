# Asides
**`<aside>`** 
The  **`<aside>`**  element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an **`<article>`** element or not.

When the  **`<aside>`**  element is used inside an **`<article>`** element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to the article it relates to.

When the  **`<aside>`**  element is used outside of an **`<article>`** element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page. For example, it might contain links to other sections of the site, a list of recent posts, a search box, or recent tweets by the author.
