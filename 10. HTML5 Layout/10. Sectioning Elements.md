# Sectioning Elements
**`<div>`**
It may seem strange to follow these new elements by revisiting the **`<div>`** element again. (After all, the new elements are often going to be used in its place.)

However, the **`<div>`** element will remain an important way to group together related elements, because you should not be using these new elements that you have just met for purposes other than those explicitly stated.

Where there is no suitable element to group a set of elements, the **`<div>`** element will still be used. 

Some people have asked why there is no **`<content>`** element to contain the main part of a page. The reason is that anything that lies outside of the **`<header>`**, **`<footer>`** or  **`<aside>`**  elements can be considered as the main content.
