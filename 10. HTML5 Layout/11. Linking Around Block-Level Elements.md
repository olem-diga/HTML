# Linking Around Block-Level Elements

HTML5 allows web page authors to place an **`<a>`** element around a block level element that contains child elements. This allows you to turn an entire block into a link.

This is not a new element in HTML5, but it was not seen as a correct usage of the **`<a>`** element in earlier versions of HTML.
