# 5.15 HTML 5 - Emain & URL Input

**`<input>`**
- HTML5 has also introduced inputs that allow visitors to enter email addresses and URLs.
- Browsers that do not support these input types will just treat them as text boxes.

**`type=“email”`**
- If you ask a user for an email address, you can use the **`email`** input.
- Browsers that support HTML5 validation will check that the user has provided information in the correct format of an email address. 
- Some smart phones also optimize their keyboard to display the keys you are most likely to need when entering an email address (such as the **`@`** symbol).

**`type=“url”`**
- A URL input can be used when you are asking a user for a web page address. Browsers that
support HTML5 validation will check that the user has provided information in the format of a
URL. Some smart phones also optimize their keyboard to display the keys you are most likely to
need when entering a URL.
