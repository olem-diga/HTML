# 5.7 File Input Box

**`<input>`**
- If you want to allow users to upload a ﬁle (for example an image, video, mp3, or a PDF), you will need to use a ﬁle input box.

**`type=“file”`**
- This type of input creates a box that looks like a text input followed by a *browse* button. When the user clicks on the *browse* button, a window opens up that allows them to select a ﬁle from their computer to be uploaded to the website.

- When you are allowing users to upload ﬁles, the method attribute on the **`<form>`** element must have a value of **`post`**. (You cannot send ﬁles using the HTTP **`get`** method.)
- When a user clicks on the *browse* button, the presentation of the window that allows them to browse for the ﬁle they want to upload will match the windows of the user's operating system. You cannot control the appearance of these windows.
