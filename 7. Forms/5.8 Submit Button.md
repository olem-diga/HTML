**`<input>`**
**`type=“submit”`**
- The submit button is used to send a form to the server.

**`name`**
- It can use a **`name`** attribute but it does not need to have one.

**`value`**
- The **`value`** attribute is used to control the text that appears on a button. It is a good idea to specify the words you want to appear on a button because the default value of buttons on some browsers is ‘Submit query’ and this might not be appropriate for all kinds of form.
- Diﬀerent browsers will show submit buttons in diﬀerent ways and tend to ﬁt the visual presentation of the browser. If you want to control the appearance of a submit button, you can either use CSS, or you can use an image for the button.
