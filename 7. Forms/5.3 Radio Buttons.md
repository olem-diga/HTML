# 5.3 Radio Buttons

**`<input>`**
**`type=“radio”`**
- Radio buttons allow users to pick just one of a number of options.

**`name`**
- The **`name`** attribute is sent to the server with the value of the option the user selects. When a question provides users with options for answers in the form of radio buttons, the value of the **`name`** attribute should be the same for all of the radio buttons used to answer that question.

**`value`**
- The **`value`** attribute indicates the value that is sent to the server for the selected option. The **`value`** of each of the buttons in a group should be diﬀerent (so that the server knows which option the user has selected).

**`checked`**
- The **`checked`** attribute can be used to indicate which value (if any) should be selected when the page loads. The value of this attribute is **`checked`**. Only one radio button in a group should use this attribute.

- *Result:*
<form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
	<p>Please select your favourite genre:
		<br />
		<input type="radio" name="genre" value="rock" checked="checked" /> Rock
		<input type="radio" name="genre" value="pop" /> Pop
		<input type="radio" name="genre" value="jazz"  /> Jazz
	</p>
</form>

- **Please note:** Once a radio button has been selected it cannot be deselected. The user can only select a diﬀerent option. If you are only allowing the user one option and want them to be able to deselect it (for example if they are indicating they agree to terms and conditions), you should use a checkbox instead.
