# 5.13 HTML 5 - Form Validation

You have probably seen forms on the web that give users messages if the form control has not been ﬁlled in correctly; this is known as **form validation**.

Traditionally, form validation has been performed using **JavaScript**. But HTML5 is introducing validation and leaving the work to the browser.

Validation helps ensure the user enters information in a form that the server will be able to understand when the form is submitted. Validating the contents of the form before it is sent to the server the helps:
- Reduce the amount of work the server has to do
- Enables users to see if there are problems with the form faster than if validation were performed on the server.

```html
<form action="http://www.example.com.login/" method="post">
	<label for="username">Username:</label>
	<input type="text" name="username" required="required" /><br>
	<label for="password">Password:</label>
	<input type="password" name="password" required="required"/>
	<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

```

- *Results:*
<form action="http://www.example.com.login/" method="post">
	<label for="username">Username: </label>
	<input type="text" name="username" required="required" /><br>
	<label for="password">Password: </label>
	<input type="password" name="password" required="required"/>
	<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

At the time of writing, only Chrome and Opera supported HTML5 validation, although other browsers are expected to follow. In order to support older browsers (that do not understand HTML5), web page authors are likely to continue using JavaScript to validate forms.

An example of HTML5 form validation is the **`required`** attribute, which can be used on any form element that the user is expected to ﬁll in. This HTML5 attribute does not need a value, but in HTML 4 all attributes must have a value. So, some people give this attribute a value of **`required`**.
