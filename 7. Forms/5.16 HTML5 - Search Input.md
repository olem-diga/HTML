**`<input>`**
- If you want to create a single line text box for search queries, HTML5 provides a special type of input for that purpose.

**`type=“search”`**
- If you want to create a single line text box for search queries, HTML5 provides a special search input.
- To create the HTML5 search box the **`<input>`** element should have a type attribute whose value is **`search`**. Older browsers will simply treat it like a single line text box.

- Recent browsers add some features that improve usability. For example, Safari on a Mac adds a cross to clear the search box when you have started to enter information. Safari also automatically rounds the corners on the search input ﬁeld.

**`placeholder`**
- On any text input, you can also use an attribute called **`placeholder`** whose value is text that will be shown in the text box until the user clicks in that area. Older browsers simply ignore this attribute.
