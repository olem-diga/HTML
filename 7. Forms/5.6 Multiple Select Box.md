**`<select>`**
**`size`**
- You can turn a drop down select box into a box that shows more than one option by adding the **`size`** attribute. Its value should be the number of options you want to show at once. In the example you can see that three of the four options are shown.

Unfortunately, the way that browsers have implemented this attribute is not perfect, and it should be tested throroughly if used (in particular in Firefox and Safari on a Mac).

**`multiple`**
- You can allow users to select multiple options from this list by adding the **`multiple`** attribute with a value of **`multiple`**.
- It is a good idea to tell users if they can select more than one option at a time. It is also helpful to indicate that on a PC they should hold down the **`control`** key while selecting multiple options and on a Mac they should use the **`command`** key while selecting options.
