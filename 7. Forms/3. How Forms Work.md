# 3. How Forms Work

A user ﬁlls in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.

A form may have several form controls, each gathering diﬀerent information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element.

To diﬀerentiate between various pieces of inputted data, information is sent from the browser to the server using name/value pairs.

If the form control allows you to choose from a ﬁxed set of answers (e.g. radio buttons, checkboxes or a drop down list), the web page author will add code that gives each option an automatic value.
