# 5.1 Password Input

**`<input>`**
**`type=“password”`**
- When the **`type`** attribute has a value of **password** it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out. They are hidden in this way so that if someone is looking over the user's shoulder, they cannot see sensitive data such as passwords.

**`name`**
- The **`name`** attribute indicates the name of the password input, which is sent to the server with the password the user enters.

**`size`**, **`maxlength`**
- It can also carry the **`size`** and **`maxlength`** attributes like the the single-line text input.

- *Example:*
```htmp
<form action="http://www.example.com/login.php">
	<p>Useranme:
		<input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
	</p>
	<p>Password:
		<input type="password" name="password" size="15" maxlength="30" />
	</p>
	</form> 
```

- *Result:*
<form action="http://www.example.com/login.php">
	<p>Useranme:
		<input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
	</p>
	<p>Password:
		<input type="password" name="password" size="15" maxlength="30" />
	</p>
	</form>

Although the password is hidden on the screen, this does not mean that the data in a password control is sent securely to the server. You should never use these for sending sensitive data such as credit card numbers.

For full security, the server needs to be set up to communicate with users' browsers using **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**.
