# Lists

- ***HTML provides us with three different types of lists***:
	- ***Ordered lists*** are lists where each item in the list is numbered
	- ***Unordered lists*** are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
	- ***Definition lists*** are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

1. [[1. Ordered Lists]]
2. [[2. Unordered Lists]]
3. [[3. Definition Lists]]
4. [[4. Nested Lists]]
