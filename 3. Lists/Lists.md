# Lists

- ***HTML provides us with three different types of lists***:
	- ***Ordered lists*** are lists where each item in the list is numbered
	- ***Unordered lists*** are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
	- ***Definition lists*** are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
