# Ordered Lists

**`<ol>`**
- The ordered list is created with the **`<ol>`** element.

**`<li>`**
- Each item in the list is placed between an opening **`<li>`** tag and a closing **`</li>`** tag. (The li stands for ***list item***.)

Browsers indent lists by default.

Sometimes you may see a ***type*** attribute used with the **`<ol>`** element to specify the type of numbering (numbers, letters, roman numerals and so on). It is better to use the CSS list-style-type property.
