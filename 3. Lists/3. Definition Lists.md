# Definition Lists

**`<dl>`**
- The definition list is created with the **`<dl>`** element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
- Inside the **`<dl>`** element you will usually see pairs of **`<dt>`** and **`<dd>`** elements.

**`<dt>`**
- This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).

**`<dd>`**
- This is used to contain the definition.
- Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different definitions for the same term.
