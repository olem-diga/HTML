# Old Code - Width & Spacing

There are some outdated attributes which you should not use on new websites. You may, however, come across some of them when looking at older code, so I will mention them here. All of these attributes have been replaced by the use of CSS.

The **`width`** attribute was used on the opening **`<table>`** tag to indicate how wide that table should be and on some opening **`<th>`** and **`<td>`** tags to specify the width of individual cells. The value of this attribute is the **width** of the table or cell in pixels.

The opening **`<table>`** tag could also use the **`cellpadding`** attribute to add space inside each cell of the table, and the **`cellspacing`** attribute to create space between each cell of the table. The values for these attributes were given in pixels.
