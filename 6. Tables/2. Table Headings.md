# Table Headings

**`<th>`**
- The **`<th>`** element is used just like the **`<td>`** element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The **th** stands for ***table heading***.)
- Even if a cell has no content, you should still use a **`<td>`** or **`<th>`** element to represent the presence of an empty cell otherwise the table will not render correctly.
- Using **`<th>`** elements for headings helps people who use screen readers, improves the ability for search engines to index your pages, and also enables you to control the appearance of tables better when you start to use CSS.

- You can use the **`scope`** attribute on the **`<th>`** element to indicate whether it is a heading for a ***column*** or a ***row***. It can take the values: ***row*** to indicate a heading for a row or ***col*** to indicate a heading for a column.
- Browsers usually display the content of a **`<th>`** element in bold and in the middle of the cell.
