# Old Code - Border & Background

The **`border`** attribute was used on both the **`<table>`** and **`<td>`** elements to indicate the width of the border in pixels.

The **`bgcolor`** attribute was used to indicate background colors of either the entire table or individual table cells. The value is usually a **hex** code.

When building a new website you should use CSS to control the appearance of the table rather than these attributes. They are only covered here because you may come across them if you look at the code of older websites.
