# Basic Table Structure

**`<table>`**
- The **`<table>`** element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

**`<tr>`**
- You indicate the start of each row using the opening **`<tr>`** tag. (The **tr** stands for ***table row***.)
- It is followed by one or more **`<td>`** elements (one for each cell in that row).
- At the end of the row you use a closing **`</tr>`** tag.

**`<td>`**
- Each cell of a table is represented using a **`<td>`** element. (The **`td`** stands for ***table data***.)
- At the end of each cell you use a closing **`</td>`** tag.

Some browsers automatically draw lines around the table and/or the individual cells. You will learn how to control the borders of tables using CSS.
