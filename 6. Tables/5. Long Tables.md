# Long Tables

There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows (which can contain different content).

These elements help people who use screen readers and also allow you to style these sections in a different manner than the rest of the table.

**`<thead>`**
- The headings of the table should sit inside the **`<thead>`** element.

**`<tbody>`**
- The body should sit inside the **`<tbody>`** element.

**`<tfoot>`**
- The footer belongs inside the **`<tfoot>`** element.

By default, browsers rarely treat the content of these elements any differently than other elements however designers often use CSS styles to change their appearance.
