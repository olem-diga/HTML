# Comments in HTML

**`<!-- -->`**
- If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:

```html
<!-- comment goes here -->
```

It is a good idea to add comments to your code because, no matter how familiar you are with the page at the time of writing it, when you come back to it later (or if someone else needs to look at the code), comments will make it much easier to understand.

Although comments are not visible to users in the main browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page.

On a long page you will often see comments used to indicate where sections of the page start or end, and to pass on notes to help anyone who is looking at the code understand it.

Comments can also be used around blocks of code to stop that code from being displayed in the browser. In the example on the left, the email link has been commented out.
