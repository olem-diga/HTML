# 3.1 Doctypes

Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a **DOCTYPE** declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).

As you will see when we come to look at CSS and its box model, the use of a **DOCTYPE** can also help the browser to render a page correctly.

Because **XHTML** was written in **XML**, you will sometimes see pages that use the **XHTML** strict **DOCTYPE** start with the optional **XML** declaration.
- Where this is used, it should be the first thing in a document.
- There must be nothing before it, not even a space.

**HTML5**
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

**HTML 4**
```<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
```

**Transitional XHTML 1.0**
```
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/
xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
```

**Strict XHTML 1.0**
```
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/
xhtml1-strict.dtd">
```

**XML Declaration**
```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
```
