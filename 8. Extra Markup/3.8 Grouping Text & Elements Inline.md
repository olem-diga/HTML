# Grouping Text & Elements Inline

**`<span>`**
- The **`<span>`** element acts like an inline equivalent of the **`<div>`** element. It is used to either:
	1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text
	2. Contain a number of inline elements

- The most common reason why people use **`<span>`** elements is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS.
- You will usually see that a **`class`** or **`id`** attribute is used with **`<span>`** elements:
	- To explain the purpose of this **`<span>`** element
	- So that CSS styles can be applied to elements that have specific values for these attributes
