# Extra Markup

## The Evolution of HTML

Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML.

Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).

There have also been several versions of each browser used to view web pages, each of which implements new code. Not all web users, however, have the latest browsers installed on their computers, which means that not everyone will be able to view all of the latest features and markup.

Where you should be particularly aware of browsers not supporting certain features, I have made a note of this (as you have seen with some of the HTML5 elements introduced in the Forms chapter - and as you will see in the CSS chapters).

1.  [[1. HTML 4]]
2.  [[2. XHTML 1.0]]
