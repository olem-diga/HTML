# ID Attribute

Every HTML element can carry the `id` attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character).

It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their `id` attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).

As you will see when you come to look at CSS, giving an element a unique identity allows you to style it differently than any other instance of the same element on the page. For example, you might want to assign one paragraph within the page (perhaps a paragraph containing a pull quote) a different style than all of the other paragraphs.

If you go on to learn about **JavaScript** (a language that allows you to add interactivity to your pages), `id` attributes can be used to allow the script to work with that particular element.

The `id` attribute is known as a ***global attribute*** because it can be used on any element.
