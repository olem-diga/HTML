# HTML 4

***Released 1997***

With the exception of a few elements added in HTML5 (which have been highlighted), the elements you have seen in this book were all available in HTML 4.

Although HTML 4 had some presentational elements to control the appearance of pages, authors are not recommended to use them any more. (Examples include the **`<center>`** element for centering content on a page, **`<font>`** for controlling the appearance of text, and **`<strike>`** to put a line through the text - all of these can be achieved with CSS instead.)
