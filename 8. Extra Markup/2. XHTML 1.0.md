# XHTML 1.0

***Released 2000***

In 1998, a language called **XML** was published. Its purpose was to allow people to write new markup languages. Since HTML was the most widely used markup language around, it was decided that HTML 4 should be reformulated to follow the rules of **XML** and it was renamed **XHTML**. This meant that authors had to follow some new, more strict rules about writing markup. 
For example:
- Every element needed a closing tag (except for empty elements such as **`<img />`** ).
- Attribute names had to be in lowercase.
- All attributes required a *value*, and all values were to be placed in *double quotes*.
- Deprecated elements should no longer be used.
- Every element that was opened inside another element should be closed inside that same element.

The examples in this book all follow these strict rules of XML.

One of the key benefits of this change was that XHTML works seamlessly with other programs that are written to create and process XML documents.

It could also be used with other data formats such as ***Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)*** - a graphical language written in **XML**, **MathML** (used to mark up mathematical formulae), and **CML** (used to mark up chemical formulae).

In order to help web page authors move to this new syntax, two main flavors of XHTML 1.0 were created:
- ***Strict XHTML 1.0***, where authors had to follow the rules to the letter
- ***Transitional XHTML 1.0***, where authors could still use presentational elements (such as **`<center>`** and **`<font>`**).

The transitional version of **XHTML** was created because it allowed authors to continue to follow older practices (with a less strict syntax) and use some of the elements and attributes that were going to be removed from future versions of HTML.

There was also a third version of ***XHTML 1.0*** called ***XHTML 1.0 Frameset***, which allowed web page authors to partition a browser window into several "frames," each of which would hold a different HTML page.
These days, frames are very rarely used and are being phased out.
