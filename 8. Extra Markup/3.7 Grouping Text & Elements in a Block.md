# Grouping Text & Elements in a Block

 **`<div>`**
- The **`<div>`** element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
- For example, you might create a **`<div>`** element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site (the logo and the navigation), or you might create a **`<div>`** element to contain comments from visitors.

In a browser, the contents of the **`<div>`** element will start on a new line, but other than this it will make no difference to the presentation of the page.

Using an **`id`** or class attribute on the **`<div>`** element, however, means that you can create CSS style rules to indicate how much space the **`<div>`** element should occupy on the screen and change the appearance of all the elements contained within it.
It can also make it easier to follow your code if you have used **`<div>`** elements to hold each section of the page.

Since there may be several other elements inside a **`<div>`** element, it can be helpful to add a comment after the closing **`</div>`** tag. This allows you to clearly see which opening tag it is supposed to correspond to, as shown at the end of the example here.
