# Escape Characters

- There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets.)

- Therefore, if you want these characters to appear on your page you need to use what are termed "***escape***" characters (also known as ***escape codes*** or ***entity references***). 
- For example, to write a left angled bracket, you can use either **`&lt;`** or **`&#60;`**. For an ampersand, you can use either **`&amp;`** or **`&#38;`**.
- There are also special codes that can be used to show symbols such as copyright and trademark, currency symbols, mathematical characters, and some punctuation marks. 
- For example, if you want to include a copyright symbol on a web page you can use either **`&copy;`** or **`&#169;`.
- When using escape characters, it is important to check the page in your browser to ensure that the correct symbol shows up. This is because some fonts do not support all of these characters and you might therefore need to specify a different font for these characters in your CSS code.
