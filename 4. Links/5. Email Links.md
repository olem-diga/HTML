# Email Links

**`mailto:`**
- To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the **`<a>`** element.
- However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with **`mailto:`** and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.
- An email link looks just like any other link but, when it is clicked on, the user's email program will open a new email message and address it to the person specified in the link.

- *Example:*
```html
<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>
