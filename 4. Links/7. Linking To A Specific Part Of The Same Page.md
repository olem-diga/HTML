# Linking To A Specific Part Of The Same Page

At the top of a long page you might want to add a list of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower down. Or you might want to add a link from part way down the page back to the top of it to save users from having to scroll back to the top.

Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will go to. You do this using the **`id`** attribute (which can be used on every HTML element).

The value of the **`id`** attribute should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character) and, on a single page, no two **`id`** attributes should have the same value.

To link to an element that uses an **`id`** attribute you use the **`<a>`** element again, but the value of the **`href`** attribute starts with the **`#`** symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute of the element you want to link to.
