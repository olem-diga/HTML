# Links

Links are created using the **`<a>`** element. Users can click on anything between the opening **`<a>`** tag and the closing **`</a>`** tag.

The value of the **`href`** attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.

- *Example:*

```html
<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>`
```
---
- *Result:*

<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>

The text between the opening **`<a>`** tag and closing **`</a>`** tag is known as ***link text.*** Where possible, your link text should explain where visitors will be taken if they click on it.

Many people navigate websites by scanning the text for links. Clear link text can help visitors find what they want. This will give them a more positive impression of your site and may encourage them to visit it for longer.

To write good link text, you can think of words people might use when searching for the page that you are linking to.
