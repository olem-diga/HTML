# Relative URLs

Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.

 When you are linking to a page on your own website, you do not need to specify the domain name. You can use relative URLs which are a shorthand way to tell the browser where a page is in relation to the current page.

Because you do not need to repeat the domain name in each link, they are also quicker to write.

If all of the files in your site are in one folder, you simply use the file name for that page.

If your site is organized into separate folders (or directories),you need to tell the browser how to get from the page it is currently on to the page that you are linking to.

If you link to the same page from two different pages you might, therefore, need to write two different relative URLs.

| ***Same Folder***<br>To link to a file in the same folder, just use the file name.                                                                                                       | To link to music reviews from the music homepage:<br>**`<a href="reviews.html">Reviews</a>`**    |
| ***Child Folder***<br>For a child folder, use the name of the child folder, followed by a forward slash, then the file name.                                                             | To link to music listings from the homepage:<br>**`<a href="music/listings.html">Listings</a>`** |
| ***Grandchild Folder***<br>Use the name of the child folder, followed by a forward slash, then the name of the grandchild folder, followed by another forward slash, then the file name. | To link to DVD reviews from the homepage:<br>**`<a href="movies/dvd/reviews.html">Reviews</a>`** |
| ***Parent Folder***<br>Use ../ to indicate the folder above the current one, then follow it with the file name.                                                                          | To link to the homepage from the music reviews:<br>**`<a href="../index.html">Home</a>`**        |
| ***GrandParent Folder***<br>Repeat the ../ to indicate that you want to go up two folders (rather than one), then follow it with the file name.                                          | To link to the homepage from the DVD reviews:<br>**`<a href="../../index.html">Home</a>`**       |
