# Directory Structure

On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.
### Structure

The top-level folder is known as the ***root*** folder.

The root folder contains all of the other files and folders for a website.

Each section of the site is placed in a separate folder; this helps organize the files.
### Relationships

The relationship between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree.
### Homepages

The main homepage of a site written in HTML (and the homepages of each section in a child folder) is called ***index.html***.

<figure align="center">
<img src="Directory structure.png" width ="80%" />
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>

Every page and every image on a website has a URL (or Uniform Resource Locator). The URL is made up of the domain name followed by the ***path*** to that page or image.

The path to the homepage of this site is www.examplearts.com/index.html.

The path to the logo for the site is examplearts.com/images/logo.gif.

**Each sub-directory contains:**
- A file called index.html which is the homepage for that section.
