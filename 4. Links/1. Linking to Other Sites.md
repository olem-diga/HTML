# Linking to Other Sites

When you link to a different website, the value of the **`href`** attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an ***absolute*** URL.

Browsers show links in blue with an underline by default.
### Absolute URLs

***URL*** stands for ***Uniform Resource Locator***. Every web page has its own URL. This is the web address that you would type into a browser if you wanted to visit that specific page.

An absolute URL starts with the domain name for that site, and can be followed by the path to a specific page. If no page is specified, the site will display the homepage.
