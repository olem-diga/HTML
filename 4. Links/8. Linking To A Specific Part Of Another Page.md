# Linking To A Specific Part Of Another Page

If you want to link to a specific part of a different page you can use a similar technique.

As long as the page you are linking to has **`id`** attributes that identify specific parts of the page, you can simply add the same syntax to the end of the link for that page.

Therefore, the **`href`** attribute will contain the address for the page (either an absolute URL or a relative URL), followed by the **`#`** symbol, followed by the value of the **`id`** attribute that is used on the element you are linking to.
