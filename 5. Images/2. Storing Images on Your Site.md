# Storing Images on Your Site

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

As a website grows, keeping images in a separate folder helps you understand how the site is organized. All of the images are stored in a folder called images.

On a big site you might like to add subfolders inside the ***images*** folder. For example, images such as logos and buttons might sit in a folder called ***interface***, product photographs might sit in a page called ***products***, and images related to news might live in a folder called ***news***.
