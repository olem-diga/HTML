# Old Code - Aligning Images Vertically

**There are three values that the align attribute can take that control how the image should align vertically with the text that surrounds it:**
**`top`**
- This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of the image.
**`middle`**
- This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle of the image.
**`bottom`**
- This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom of the image.
