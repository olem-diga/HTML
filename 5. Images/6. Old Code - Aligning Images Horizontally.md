# Old Code - Aligning Images Horizontally

**`align`**
- The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images.

**The align attribute can take these horizontal values:**
**`left`**
- This aligns the image to the *left* (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side).
**`right`**
- This aligns the image to the *right* (allowing text to flow around its left-hand side).
