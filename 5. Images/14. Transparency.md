# Transparency

**Creating an image that is partially transparent for the web involves selecting one of two formats:**
1. ***Transparent GIF***
	1. If the transparent part of the image has straight edges and it is 100% transparent (that is, not semi-opaque), you can save the image as a GIF (with the transparency option selected).
2. ***PNG***
	1. If the transparent part of the image has diagonal or rounded edges or if you want a semi-opaque transparency or a drop-shadow, then you will need to save it as a PNG.
