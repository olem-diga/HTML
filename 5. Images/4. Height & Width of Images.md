# Height & Width of Images

**An `<img>` element use two other attributes that specify its size:**
**`height`**
- This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
**`width`**
- This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
---
- *Example:*
```html
<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" width="600" height="450" />
```

---
- *Results:*
<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" width="600" height="450" />

Images often take longer to load than the HTML code that makes up the rest of the page. It is, therefore, a good idea to specify the size of the image so that the browser can render the rest of the text on the page while leaving the right amount of space for the image that is still loading.

The size of images is increasingly being specified using CSS rather than HTML.
