# Image Dimensions

The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.

 It is important to understand how you can alter the dimensions of an image.
1. ***Reducing Image Size*** 
	1. You can reduce the size of images to create a smaller version of the image.
	2. This will create an image that is quicker to download.
2. ***Increasing Image Size***
	1. You can't increase the size of photos significantly without affecting the image quality.
	2. The image will look blurry or blocky.
3. ***Changing Shape***
	1. Only some images can be cropped without losing valuable information.
	2. Only some images can be cropped and still make sense.
