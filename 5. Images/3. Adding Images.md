# Adding Images

**`<img>`**
- To add an image into the page you need to use an **`<img>`** element. This is an empty element (which means there isno closing tag). 
- ***It must carry the following two attributes:***
	**`src`**
	- This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.
	**`alt`**
	- This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
	**`title`**
	- You can also use the **`title`** attribute with the **`<img>`** element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

- *Example:*
```html
<img src="/Ω Assets/images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian
marsupial that is similar in size to the
domestic cat." />
```
---
- *Result:*

<img src="/Ω Assets/images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian
marsupial that is similar in size to the
domestic cat." />

The text used in the **`alt`** attribute is often referred to as ***alt text***. It should give an accurate description of the image content so it can be understood by screen reader software (used by people with visual impairments) and search engines.

If the image is just to make a page look more attractive (and it has no meaning, such as a graphic dividing line), then the alt attribute should still be used but the quotes should be left empty.
