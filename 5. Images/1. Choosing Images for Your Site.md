# Choosing Images for Your Site

A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description.

Remember that all images are subject to copyright, and you can get in trouble for simply taking photographs from another website.

If you have a page that shows several images (such as product photographs or members of a team) then putting them on a simple, consistent background helps them look better as a group.

- ***Images Should...***
	- Be relevant
	- Convey information
	- Convey the right mood
	- Be instantly recognizable
	- Fit the color palette
