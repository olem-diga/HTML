# Vector Images

Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as ***Adobe Illustrator***.

***Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)*** are a relatively new format used to display vector images directly on the web (eliminating the need to create bitmap versions of them), however its use is not yet widespread.
