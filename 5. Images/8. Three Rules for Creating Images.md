# Three Rules for Creating Images

1. ***Save Images in the Right Format*** - Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format. If you choose the wrong image format then your image might not look as sharp as it should and can make the web page slower to load.
2. ***Save Images at the Right Size*** - You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website. If the image is smaller than the width or height that you have specified, the image can be distorted and stretched. If the image is larger than the width and height if you have specified, the image will take longer to display on the page.
3. ***Use the Correct Resolution*** - Computer screens are made up of dots known as ***pixels***. Images used on the web are also made up of tiny dots. ***Resolution*** refers to the number of dots per inch, and most computer screens only show web pages at 72 pixels per inch. So saving images at a higher resolution results in images that are larger than necessary and take longer to download.
