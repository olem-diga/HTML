# Image Formats - JPEG

Whenever you have many different colors in a picture you should use a **JPEG**.

A photograph that features snow or an overcast sky might look like it has large areas that are just white or gray, but the picture is usually made up of many different colors that are subtly different.

 Use **GIF** or **PNG** format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

When a picture has an area that is filled with exactly the same color, it is known as ***flat color.*** Logos, illustrations, and diagrams often use flat colors.
