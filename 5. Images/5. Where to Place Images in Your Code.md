# Where to Place Images in Your Code

**Where you place the image in the code is important because browsers show HTML elements in one of two ways:**
- **Block elements always appear on a new line**. If the **`<img>`** is followed by a block level element (such as a paragraph) then the block level element will sit on a new line after the image.
- **Inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line.** If the **`<img>`** element is inside a block level element, any text or other inline elements will flow around the image.
