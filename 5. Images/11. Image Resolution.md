# Image Resolution

Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.

JPGs, GIFs, and PNGs belong to a type of image format known as ***bitmap***. They are made up of lots of miniature squares.

Images in print materials (such as books and magazines) are made up of tiny circles called ***dots***. These images are usually printed at a resolution of ***300*** dots per inch (dpi).

Due to the fact that computer displays are capped at a resolution of 72 ppi, using images on the web with a higher resolution will not result in better image quality - only in larger file sizes, which will increase the time needed to load them and therefore slow down viewing of your web pages.
