# HTML5 - Figure and Figure Caption

**`<figure>`**
- Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new **`<figure>`** element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.
- You can have more than one image inside the **`<figure>`** element as long as they all share the same caption.

**`<figcaption>`**
- The **`<figcaption>`** element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.
- Before these elements were created there was no way to associate an **`<img>`** element with its caption.

- *Example:*
```html
<figure>
<img src="/Ω Assets/images/otters.jpg" alt="Photograph of two sea otters floating in water">
<br>
<figcaption>Sea otters hold hands when they sleep so they don't drift away from each other.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

- *Result*

<figure>
<img src="/Ω Assets/images/otters.jpg" alt="Photograph of two sea otters floating in water">
<br>
<figcaption>Sea otters hold hands when they sleep so they don't drift away from each other.</figcaption>
</figure>
