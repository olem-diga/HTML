# 6. Horizontal Rules

**`<br>`**
- The browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag **`<br>`**.

**`<hr>`**
-  You can add a horizontal rule between sections using the **`<hr>`** tag.

There are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. They are known as ***empty elements*** and they are written differently.

An empty element usually has only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character. Some web page authors miss this out but it is good habit to get into.
