# Changes to Content

**`<ins>`**
**`<del>`**
- The **`<ins>`** element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the **`<del>`** element can show text that has been deleted from it.

---
- *Example:*
```html
<p>It was the <del>worst</del> <ins>best</ins> idea she had ever had.</p>
```
---
- *Result:*
<p>It was the <del>worst</del> <ins>best</ins> idea
she had ever had.</p>

---
The content of a **`<ins>`** element is usually underlined, while the content of a **`<del>`** element usually has a line through it.

**`<s>`**
- The **`<s>`** element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).
- Visually the content of an **`<s>`** element will usually be displayed with a line through the center.
- Older versions of HTML had a **`<u>`** element for content that was underlined, but this is being phased out.

- *Example:*
```html
<p>Laptop computer:</p>
<p><s>Was $995</s></p>
<p>Now only $375</p>
```
---
- *Result:*
<p>Laptop computer:</p>
<p><s>Was $995</s></p>
<p>Now only $375</p>
