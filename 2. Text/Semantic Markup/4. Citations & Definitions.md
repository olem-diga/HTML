# Citations & Definitions

**`<cite>`**
- When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or research paper, the **`<cite>`** element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.

- *Example:*

```html
<p><cite>A Brief History of Time</cite> by Stephen Hawking has sold over ten million copies worldwide.</p>
```
---
- *Result:*
<p><cite>A Brief History of Time</cite> by Stephen Hawking has sold over ten million copies worldwide.</p>

In HTML5, **`<cite>`** should not really be used for a person's name - but it was allowed in HTML 4, so most people are likely to continue to use it.

Browsers will render the content of a **`<cite>`** element in italics.

**`<dfn>`**
- The first time you explain some new terminology (perhaps an academic concept or some jargon) in a document, it is known as the defining instance of it.
- The **`<dfn>`** element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term.
- Some browsers show the content of the **`<dfn>`** element in italics. Safari and Chrome do not change its appearance.
