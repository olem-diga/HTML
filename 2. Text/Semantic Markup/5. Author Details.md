# Author Details

**`<address>`**
- The **`<address>`** element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.
- It can contain a physical address, but it does not have to. For example, it may also contain a phone number or email address.
- Browsers often display the content of the **`<address>`** element in italics.
