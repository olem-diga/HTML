# Abbreviations & Acronyms

**`<abbr>`**
- If you use an ***abbreviation*** or an ***acronym***, then the **`<abbr>`** element can be used. A ***title*** attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.
- In HTML 4 there was a separate **`<acronym>`** element for acronyms. To spell out the full form of the acronym, the title attribute was used (as with the **`<abbr>`** element above).
- HTML5 just uses the **`<abbr>`** element for both abbreviations and acronyms.
