## Semantic Markup

- There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages - they are known as ***semantic markup***.

- Browsers often display the contents of these elements in a different way.
- You should not use them to change the way that your text looks; their purpose is to describe the content of your web pages more accurately.

- The reason for using these elements is that other programs, such as screen readers or search engines, can use this extra information. For example, the voice of a screen reader may add emphasis to the words inside the **`<em>`** element, or a search engine might register that your page features a quote if you use the **`<blockquote>`** element.
