# Adding A Flash MP3 Player

- There are many MP3 players that have already been written in Flash, such as:
	flash-mp3-player.net
	musicplayer.sourceforge.net
	www.wimpyplayer.com
- Each of these players has different functionality, so check their features before choosing one for your site.

- *Example:*
```html
<html>
<head>
		 <title>Adding a Flash MP3 Player</title>
		 <script type="text/javascript"
			 src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/
			 swfobject/2.2/swfobject.js"></script>
			 
		 <script type="text/javascript">
			 var flashvars = {};
			 var params = {mp3: "audio/test-audio.mp3"};
			 swfobject.embedSWF(
				 "flash/player_mp3_1.0.0.swf",
				 "music-player", "200", "20", "8.0.0",
				 flashvars, params);</script>
</head>
<body>
		 <div id="music-player">
			 <p>You cannot hear this track because this
				 browser does not support our Flash music
				 player.</p>
		 </div>
</body>
</html>
```
- *Result:*
<html>
<head>
		 <title>Adding a Flash MP3 Player</title>
		 <script type="text/javascript"
			 src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/
			 swfobject/2.2/swfobject.js"></script>
		 <script type="text/javascript">
			 var flashvars = {};
			 var params = {mp3: "audio/test-audio.mp3"};
			 swfobject.embedSWF(
				 "flash/player_mp3_1.0.0.swf",
				 "music-player", "200", "20", "8.0.0",
				 flashvars, params);</script>
</head>
<body>
		 <div id="music-player">
			 <p>You cannot hear this track because this
				 browser does not support our Flash music
				 player.</p>
		 </div>
</body>
</html>

- This example uses a free player from flash-mp3-player.net which is embedded in the page using the SWFObject technique. The player is told the path to the MP3 file using a parameter called mp3.
- After the second **`<script>`** tag, you can see that we have created two JavaScript variables; the first called **`flashvars`**, the second called **`params`**. Even though we are not using the flashvars variable, the SWFObject script expects it before the params variable so we need it there.
```js
var flashvars = {};
var params = {
mp3: "music/noise.mp3"};
```

- These variables are then added at the end of the line that embeds the MP3 player in the page (just before the second closing **`<script>`** tag).
