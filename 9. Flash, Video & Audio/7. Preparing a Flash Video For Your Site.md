# Preparing a Flash Video For Your Site

- There are three steps you need to follow to add a Flash Video to your web page:
### 1. Convert Your Video into FLV Format

- To play a Flash Video, you need to convert your video into FLV format. Since Flash 6, the Flash authoring environment has come with a Flash Video Encoder to convert videos into FLV format.
- Some Flash video players also support  ***H264*** format (and some video editing programs export video in this format).
### 2. Find an FLV Player to Play the Video

- You'll need a player written in Flash to play the FLV file. Its purpose is to hold the FLV movie and add controls such as play/pause. Here are two sites that offer FLV players:
	- www.osflv.com
	- www.longtailvideo.com
- You do not need the Flash authoring environment to use either of these on your website.
### 3. Include the Player & Video in Your Page

- You can include the player in your page using a JavaScript technique such as SWFObject.
- You will also need to tell the player where it can find the video file that you want it to play. (Some players have advanced features such as the ability to create playlists of multiple videos, or add a still picture before the video plays.)
