# Use of Flash

Since 2005, a number of factors have meant that fewer websites are written in Flash or even use elements of Flash in their pages.

When Flash was first released, it was developed to create animations. The technology quickly evolved, however, and people started to use it to build media players and even entire websites.

Although Flash is still very popular, in recent years people have been more selective about when they use it (and now rarely consider building an entire website in Flash).

Despite this, Flash does have a future on the web because there are some things it does very well, such as creating animations.

There are several reasons why fewer websites are using Flash these days, including:
- In 2005-6, a set of **JavaScript libraries** were launched (including **Prototype**, **script.aculo.us**, and **JQuery**) which made it easier for people to create animated effects using JavaScript.
- When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007 and later the the iPad in 2010, they took the decision not to support Flash.
- There have been laws introduced to ensure that websites are usable by those with visual or physical impairments and Flash has been criticized because Flash content does not always meet accessibility requirements.
- In 2008, browsers started to support HTML5 **`<video>`** and **`<audio>`** tags. At the time of writing, Flash is still a popular way of playing video and audio on the web but more and more people are switching to HTML5.
