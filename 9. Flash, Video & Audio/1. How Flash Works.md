# How Flash Works

Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animations, and later for playing audio and video in websites.

Whether you are creating an animation or a media player in Flash, the files you put on your website are referred to as ***Flash movies***.

When you create a Flash file in the Flash authoring environment, it is saved with the **`.fla`** file extension. In order to use this file on a web page it has to be saved in a different format known as ***SWF***. (It has the **`.swf`** file extension.)

When you export the movie into SWF format, Flash creates code that you can use to embed the Flash movie in your page. Traditionally, this code used the HTML **`<object>`** and **`<embed>`** tags. However, now it is more common to use JavaScript.

To view Flash, browsers need to use a plugin (an extra piece of software that runs in the browser) called the Flash Player. Statistics commonly indicate that 98% of browsers on desktop computers have the Flash plugin installed.
