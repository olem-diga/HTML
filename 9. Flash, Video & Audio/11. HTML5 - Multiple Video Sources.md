# HTML5 - Multiple Video Sources

**`<source>`**
- To specify the location of the file to be played, you can use the **`<source>`** element inside the **`<video>`** element. (This should replace the **`src`** attribute on the opening **`<video>`** tag.)
- You can also use multiple **`<source>`** elements to specify that the video is available in different formats.
- (Due to a bug on the iPad, you should provide the MP4 video as the first format. Otherwise, it might not play.)

**`src`**
- This attribute specifies the path to the video.

**`type`**
- You should use this attribute to tell the browser what format the video is. Otherwise, it will download some of the video to see if it can play the file (which will take time and bandwidth).

**`codecs`**
- The codec that was used to encode the video is supplied within the type attribute. Note the use of single quotes, as well as double quotes in the type attribute, when it is supplied.

- If the browser does not support the **`<video>`** element or the format of video used, it will display whatever is between the opening **`<video>`** and closing **`</video>`** tags.
