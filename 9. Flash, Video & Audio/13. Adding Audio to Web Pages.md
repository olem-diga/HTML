# Adding Audio to Web Pages

By far the most popular format for putting audio on web pages is MP3. As with video, there are three routes commonly taken:
1. **Use a Hosted Service**
	1. There are several sites that allow you to upload your audio, and provide a player which you can embed in your page, such as SoundCloud.com.
2. **Use Flash**
	1. There are several Flash movies that allow you to play MP3 files; from simple buttons that play one track to complex players that allow you to create playlists and juke boxes.
3. **Use HTML5**
	1. HTML5 has introduced a new **`<audio>`** element. Browsers that support this element provide their own controls - much as they do for the video files we just looked at.

- Some people ask how to get music to play consistently even when visitors move from one page to another on a website.
- This is actually quite difficult to achieve and would rely on techniques like using AJAX to load page content or developing the entire site in Flash.
- This is why some sites offer audio players in new windows, so that listeners are not interrupted when they move between pages.
