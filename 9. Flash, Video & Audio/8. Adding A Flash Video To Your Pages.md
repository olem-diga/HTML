# Adding A Flash Video To Your Pages

- This example uses the OS FLV player to display a video called **`puppy.flv`**, which has already been convered into FLV format.
- Sometimes Flash movies need information in order for them to work.
- In the example, the video player needs to know the path to the video it has to play, so SWFObject uses JavaScript variables to pass this information to the Flash movie. These are provided in the two lines of code that start with var.
- This particular player is not expecting any information in the flashvars variable, so that is left empty.
- The path to the movie is supplied in the variable called **`params`**.
```css
var params = {movie:
"../videos/puppy.flv"};
```

- The line after the variables is the one that tells the script to replace the HTML element with the video player. It is very similar to the one you saw in the earlier example that introduced SWFObject.
- Different video players usually require information such as the path to the video in slightly different formats, but they usually come with examples and documentation to help you understand how to use them.
