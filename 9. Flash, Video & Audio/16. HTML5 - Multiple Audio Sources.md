# HTML5 - Multiple Audio Sources

**`<source>`**
- It is possible to specify more than one audio file using the **`<source>`** element between the opening **`<audio>`** and closing **`</audio>`** tags (instead of the **`src`** attribute on the opening **`<audio>`** tag).
- This is important because different browsers support different formats for audio files.
- **`MP3`**: Safari 5+, Chrome 6+, IE9
- **`Ogg Vorbis`**: Firefox 3.6, Chome 6, Opera 1.5, IE9

- So you would need to supply two audio formats to get coverage across all recent browsers that support the **`<audio>`** element. You could also provide a Flash alternative for older browsers that do not support the **`<audio>`** element.

- The HTML5 **`<audio>`** tag has not gained as widespread adoption as the **`<video>`** tag, and there have been some issues with audio quality in the first browsers to implement it.
**`src`**
- The <source> element uses the **`src`** attribute to indicate where the audio file is located.

**`type`**
- At the time of writing, the **`type`** attribute was not commonly being used on the **`<source>`** element in the same way it was for the **`<video>`** element.

		 <title>Multiple Audio Sources</title>
</head>
<body>
		 <audio controls autoplay>
			 <source src="audio/test-audio.ogg" />

			 format.</p>
		 </audio>
</body>
</html>
```

			 <source src="test-audio.ogg" />
			 <source src="test-audio.mp3" />
