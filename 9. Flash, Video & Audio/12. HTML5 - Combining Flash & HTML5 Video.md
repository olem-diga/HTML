# HTML5 - Combining Flash & HTML5 Video

By offering your videos in both HTML5 and Flash Video formats, you will ensure that it can be viewed by the majority of users on your site.

You may choose to offer HTML5 as the first option, and Flash video as a fallback for people whose browser does not support HTML5 video. Or you may work the other way around.

Because some of the video players built in Flash support H264 encoding, if you use a player that supports this format you would only need to provide the video in H264 and WebM formats. (You would not need it in FLV format as well.)

- If you start to work with HTML5 video in depth, you can also:
	- Create your own playback controls
	- Provide different versions of the video for browsers that have different sized screens (so you can provide lower resolution content for handheld devices)
	- Tell different parts of a page to change when the video reaches a certain point.
