# HTML5 - Preparing Video For Your Pages

- Despite the HTML5 **`<video>`** element being a very recent addition, it is enjoying widespread use. Here are some of the key issues to be aware of:
### Support

- The new HTML5 **`<video>`** element is only supported by recent browsers, so you cannot just use this one technique if you want everyone to be able to see your video (you need to combine this HTML5 with Flash Video).
### Digital Rights

- At the time of writing, the **`<video>`** element does not support any type of Digital Rights Management (DRM - sometimes referred to as copy protection). But a dedicated pirate will usually find a way around DRM.
### Formats

- Not all browsers support the same video formats. Therefore, you need to supply your video in more than one format.
- To reach as many browsers as possible, you should provide the video in the following formats:
	- `H264`: IE and Safari
	- `WebM`: Android, Chrome, Firefox, Opera

- Chrome, Firefox, and Opera have indicated that they will support a format called ***WebM***.
### Controls

- The browser supplies its own controls for the player, and these can vary from browser to browser. You can control the appearance of these controls using JavaScript.
### In the Browser

- One of the problems with players such as the Flash Player is that they can behave inconsistently when elements such as menus drop over them, or the window is scaled up or down. The HTML5 option solves these issues.
